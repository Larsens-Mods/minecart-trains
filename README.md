# Minecart Trains Mod

This mod allows you to build more realistic Minecart trains in Minecraft while trying to stay close to vanilla mechanics.

## Features

Currently the mod only allow you to chain Minecarts together. This is done by sneak-clicking the first cart of your train with a chain in your hand and then on the next one down. This process can be repeated as often as desired to construct your train.

Only the front cart can be pushed by the player and is the only one to be affected by booster rails, all other cars just act as wagons. Chaining works with all types of Minecarts.

## Compatibility

This mod requires FabricAPI to work. This mod **IS** compatible with the new Minecart-Improvement experiment in the game.
